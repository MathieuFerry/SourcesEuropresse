It is a reference in the field of consumption. It is now published by Les Editons Protegez-Vous, a non-profit organization. The magazine's mission is to educate and inform consumers, heighten the awareness of merchants, manufacturers and advertisers to the needs of consumers, and to evaluate products and services. Protegez-Vous also has special features, practical guides and a Web site that has made it possible to diversify its activities, which are now a major source of information for all consumers. Protegez-Vous is renowned for taking its mandate very seriously. The magazine's core activities include carrying out tests on products and investigating services. For tests, strict procedures are entrusted to project leaders with degrees in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemicals or food sciences and technologies. All tests are carried out by recognized laboratories using testing protocols developed by project leaders and the test department manager. Tests are based on Canadian, U.S. and international testing standards. These standards, written by committees of experts, are reliable and have been tested on many occasions. For service investigations, the project leader uses the services of an expert or a committee of experts recognized for their credibility and strictness in their respective fields. This Committee must corroborate the project leader's interpretation of the results before his or her article can be submitted to the Editorial Committee. The special editions on cars (April) and toys (November) are published in collaboration with two organizations, Option consommateurs for toys and the Automobile Protection Association for cars. Over the years, the journalists of Protegez-Vous have won awards and honours for their work, both for the quality of the content and writing, and for their commitment to consumers.","http://www.protegez-vous.ca/","PV","01/01/2002","01/12/2003"

Since their inception in the market, the English-language Vietnam Investment Review and its Vietnamese-language sisters Dau tu (Investment) and Dau tu Chung khoan (Securities Investment) have become Vietnam’s trailblazing newspapers covering a comprehensive political, social, business and economic life in Vietnam. Not just being the most reliable and comprehensive sources of information for decision makers from government agencies, business communities and international organisations, the newspapers have been an important channel for the decision makers to conduct two-way dialogues with the public. The newspapers have earned their reputation as leading international business and economics newspapers published in Vietnam due to their insightful and objective position on publishing real business and economic issues. As key business and economic publications, our readers comprise the largest grouping of business people, business leaders and government officials. This is shown by the fact that 97 per cent of all foreign companies and representative offices in Vietnam, and all senior government officials receive regular copies of Vietnam Investment Review, Dau tu and Dau tu Chung khoan.","http://www.vir.com.vn/","WVABU","25/04/2024",NA
